Guardroom
 
Worn armor and rusting weapons hang on racks, hinting at the presence of once-vigilant defenders. A small table in the corner holds scattered playing cards and a half-empty flask, as if the guards abandoned their post in a hurry. A faint creak in the shadows suggests you may not be alone.
