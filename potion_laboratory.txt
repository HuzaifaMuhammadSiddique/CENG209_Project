Potion Laboratory
 
Bubbling cauldrons and shelves of colorful vials fill this room with strange aromas and faint hissing sounds. A layer of dust covers most surfaces, except for a table with fresh scorch marks and an open spellbook. The air hums with magical energy, as if the experiments here never truly ended.
